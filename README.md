openDOS
============

Somewhat feature-rich DOS-Type Operating System. At some point I will do a Retro-Version which will contain COMPUTE, a BASIC-Type Operating System.
COMPUTE will be a completely seperate Operating System, taking openDOS as a basis. You may find more Information later on.
Don't ask me for anything because honestly I can't be fucked.
